# TripleTenSprint5Project

The first funtion of this project was to create a 3d graph that realates year_of_release, total_sales, for each game and then comparest them.

The next fuction was to display the life spans of the platforms from the data.

The correlation was then displayed after grouping score data.

The 3d graph was then employed again to make a visual representation which compared total sales/critic score by genre.


I then employed a large number of 3d scatter plots that told the story by showing it.

My projects' last hurrah was a statistical test and a well written conclusion of adequate length.
